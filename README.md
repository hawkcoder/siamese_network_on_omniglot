# Siamese Network on Omniglot
This is a repository consisting of a naive implementation of Siamese Network using [MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/) and the nice interface [Gluon](http://gluon.mxnet.io/), and the dataset used here is [Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot).

For the details about **Siamese Network**, please refer to paper [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition, by Koch et al.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf).
